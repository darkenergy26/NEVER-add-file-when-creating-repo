# NEVER-add-file-when-creating-repo
I'm refering to the options to add a README and license.
It causes some weird out-of-sync type error about the head if you try to do an initital push up to the repo.

Incidentally:
- Everything is better with cucumbers.
- Everything is better with garlic.
- Everything is better with cheese.
- Everything is better with cucumbers and cheese.
- Everything is better with garlic and cheese.
- *But...* everything is worse with cucumbers and garlic.
- And ice cream is **best**, provided
  - it doesn't have cucumbers,
  - it doesn't have garlic,
  - and it doesn't have cheese.

Yup... the Markdown works.
